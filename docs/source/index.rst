Welcome to Cryptoserve's documentation!
=======================================

**Cryptoserve** is a server framework that hosts a library of cryptography-related exercises,
designed to help students learn a broad range of cryptographic concepts through hands-on experimentation.

Each exercise defines a protocol in which **Cryptoserve** controls one side of the interaction.
Students are responsible for implementing the other side of the exchange in order to complete the challenge.
